Fig 8. Model regulatory network and output.

(A) Schematic showing how spatiotemporal regulatory factors (PGRAD, MID, LATE, LAM, PMF) act on
473 components of specified growth (Kpar, Kper) and cell division (CDIV and Ā) to influence resultant growth, cell
474 division, cell size, and organ shape and size. Magenta arrow shows an optional feedback on growth rate from
475 cell size. Cyan arrow shows feedback from cell size to division (B-D) Model regulatory networks for early stages
476 of leaf development (124 – 182h).

(B) Growth regulatory network (KRN). Epidermal specific interactions are
denoted with red lines, subepidermal specific in light blue, and interactions common to both models in black.

(C) The regulatory network for competence to divide (CDIV).

(D) The division threshold (Ā) regulatory network.

(E-H) Model output leaves (left to right), at 115h, 132h, 140h, 147h, 156h, 164h, 178h, for the (E-F)
480 subepidermis model and (G-H) epidermis model.

(E) Area and pattern of v-cells (heat map) with intercellular spaces (white).

(F) v-cells that were competent to divide (green), and either executed division during the
interval (light green), or divided in a later interval (dark green). Cells that did not divide (white).

(G) Area and pattern of v-cells (heat map).

(H) v-cells that were competent to divide (green), and either executed division
during the interval (light green), or divided in a later interval (dark green). Cells that did not divide (white).






Fig 9. Cell areas, numbers and leaf sizes at later developmental stages

(A) Cell areas for spch leaf at later stages (earlier stages shown in S4 Figure). Leaf widths (left to right) 1.1, 1.4,
1.8, 2.1 and 2.8 mm. Leaf outline indicated by dotted black line. Grey boxes are aligned to the petiole-lamina
boundary and extend to 150 or 300 μm.

(B) Model output at equivalent stages to experimental data (model times 201h, 219h, 243h, 264h and 412h).

(C-I) Limit-free spch epidermal model outputs at maturity.

(C) Wild type.

(D) Cell division threshold increased by 85 μm2.

(E) Cell division threshold decreased by 85 μm2.

(F) Specified growth rate reduced by 5%.

(G) Specified growth rate increased by 5%.

(H) LATE comes on 6h earlier.

(I) LATE comes on 6h later.

(J-P) Limiting cell size spch epidermal model outputs at maturity.

(J) Wild type.

(K) Cell division threshold increased by 85 μm2.

(L) Cell division threshold decreased by 85 μm2.

(M) Specified growth rate reduced by 5%.

(N) Specified growth increased by 5%.

(O) LATE comes on 6h earlier.

(P) LATE 605 comes on 6h later.

Number of cells (# Cells), average cell area (μ CA) in μm2 and leaf area (Leaf A) in mm2 are
606 shown for each model. Percentage values for mutants show relative difference to feedback-free (C) and cell-
607 feedback (J) wild-type models. Scale bars 1 mm.
