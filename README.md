This is a computational model associated with the paper "Spatiotemporal coordination of cell division and growth during organ morphogenesis", by Fox S, Southam P, Pantin F, Kennaway R, Robinson S, Castorina G, et al., appearing in PLoS Biol 16 (10): [e2005952](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2005952).

The model is in the folder:

GPT\_arLeafCellDiv\_V24\_20180815

It can be run using the Matlab package GFtbox, which is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/JIC-Enrico-Coen/GrowthToolbox). GFtbox requires a current installation of Matlab, which is commercial software available from [Mathworks](https://Mathworks.com).
